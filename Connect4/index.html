      <h1>Welcome to the exhilarating world of Connect4!</h1>
      <p>
        Objective: Be the first to line up four of your colored discs
        vertically, horizontally, or diagonally while outwitting your opponent
        with lightning-fast moves. But here's the twist: you've got to be quick
        on your feet because there's a timer ticking away, daring you to make
        your move before it's your opponent's turn! With every second counting,
        can you outsmart your rival and achieve victory in this high-speed
        battle of wits?
